DESCRIPTIVE ABSTRACT:

These data contain information from a 1 - 3 matched design studying the
risk factors associated with benign breast disease.  The data are a subset
from a hospital based case-control study designed to examine the
epidemiology of fibrocystic breast disease.  Data are provided on 50 women
who were diagnosed as having benign breast disease and 150 age matched
controls, with three controls per case.  Matching was based on the age of
the subject at the time of interview.

Cases included women with a biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of fibrocystic 
breast disease identified through two hospitals in New Haven, Connecticut.
Controls were selected from among patients admitted to the general surgery,
orthopedic, or otolaryngologic services at the same two hospitals.  Trained
interviewers administered a standardized structured questionnaire to collect
information from each subject [see Pastides et al. (1983) and Pastides, 
et al. (1985)].
